# Face_Rec_ML

Face Detection and Recognition using Machine Learning Algorithms
- Haar Cascade Classifier (a predefined supervised model for face recognition)
- From a Selected ROI(region of interest), it follows binary pattern filter to detect a face

NOTE:- add training Images & :C/Python Projects/Face_Rec_ML/Face_CET.h5 (Hierarichal Data Format5-large) to run a diagonstic on data.
